## What is the Scale

The Skillz Hax scale is personality type test/ranking. It judges your qualities and gives you a ranking based on your answers. The four main types are: Skillz | Hax | Jerk | Nerd

## The Types

These are some summaries of each of the types. It is also possible to be a hybrid between two types. Please note that these do not judge everything about you, and are just one metric of your Skillz Hax.

### Skillz

A **Skillz** person is a cool dude. They're nice people, and also are liked by almost everybody. However, they don't *often* abuse their skillz or use it maliciously. However, they can be overconfident or at times self conscious, which can lead to some problems.

### Hax

A **Hax** person is someone who is either a genius, or is a really good coder/hacker. Not only can they code really well, they can also *hack* the real world the live in. Therefore, hax people can be very charismatic or very hated.

### Jerk

A **Jerk** person (often confused with a **Skillz** person) is someone who is very popular, yet nonetheless cruel and unforgiving. Someone who is popular is not by definition a jerk. You only are a jerk if you abuse your charisma to be mean to people. It's easy to unbecome a jerk.

### Nerd

A **Nerd** person (often confused with a **Hax** person) is a gamer. Nerds tend to have no real world abilities outside of gaming or browsing (especially 4chan or LeafyIsHere comment sections). However, nerds should not be judged, as they also can have very redeeming qualities.
